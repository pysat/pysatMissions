pysatMissions allows users to run build simulated satellites for Two-Line Elements (TLE) and add empirical data.  It includes the pysat_ephem and pysat_sgp4 instrument modules which can be imported into pysat.

Main Features
-------------
- Simulate satellite orbits from TLEs and add data from empirical models
- Import magnetic coordinates through apexpy and aacgmv2
- Import geomagnetic basis vectors through pysatMagVect

This document covers installation, a tutorial on pysatMissions including demonstration code, and an API reference.
